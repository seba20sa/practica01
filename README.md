For the first website 
(https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-xperia-5-ii-1151606/)
I styled the main body at the center like it is on the website and
the footer extending 100% of the body element. 

For the second objective I added two new index files named after and included
the CCS files for the second website from BBC 
(https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54476524). All the img files for the two
sites are in the same media folder.
