                Sony is making lots of bold claims about the Xperia 5 II, which 
                are centered on its speed and size. The company is aiming 
                squarely at photography, gaming, and media buffs as the Xperia 5
                 II’s prime customer segment. Can it find an audience in these 
                 multimedia lovers?

                The Sony Xperia 5 II is Sony’s second take on an affordable flags
                hip. The company <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony
                -xperia-5-1025743/" 
                target="_blank">revealed</a> the original Xperia 5 in September 
                2019 and thus this sequel arrives right on time for the 2020 
                holiday shopping season. It’s a slim, average-sized phone that 
                proffers to deliver all the power of a flagship in an easy-to-
                use piece of hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sony says the Xperia 5 II was “built for speed” and “made 
                compact.” More specifically, it was built for gaming speed, 
                imaging speed, and performance speed, and made for “perfect 
                hand and pocket fit.” In order to meet these marketing 
                milestones, Sony gave the phone a top processor and specs. It 
                cut very few corners and made every effort to make the phone a 
                totable tower of power.

                Sony centered the Xperia 5 II around three tentpoles: imaging, 
                gaming, and performance.
            </p>
            <p>The phone is a slim, tall slab. Sony markets the phone as compact
                , but we disagree. It’s the exact same dimension as last year’s 
                Xperia 5, which we called “not so compact” in our review. It’s 
                certainly smaller than many of today’s uber flagships, but it’s 
                not a dainty device, either. That said, the 5 II is a <a

                USB-C port, stereo speakers, and a pleasing piano black finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sony likes to borrow imaging tech from its Alpha line of cameras 
                and this year is no different. The Xperia 5 II adopts a triple 
                12MP system for its standard, wide, and telephoto lenses. The 
                focal lengths mimic those of certain types of lenses, such as a 
                16mm wide-angle, 24mm standard, and 70mm telephoto. They all 
                rely on Zeiss lenses with real-time eye autofocus for both 
                humans and animals. The sensor is much bigger than last year’s 
                phone at f/1.7, which allows it to perform better in low light. 
                The camera relies on Sony’s Bionz engine and has the ability to 
                shoot bursts at 20fps with continuous autofocus tracking. The 
                phone can shoot in RAW+JPEG mode for the ultimate in editing 
                flexibility.

                The phone is no video slouch. Sony paired with CineAlta so the 
                phone can shoot at the 21:9 cinema ratio with advanced color 
                reproduction. Moreover, it can handle 4K video capture at speeds 
                up to 120fps for ultra-smooth slow motion. New USB tethering 
                allows owners of the <a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-a7s-iii-camera-

                target="_blank">Sony A7S III camera</a> to send files via USB-C 
                to the phone for FTP upload.
            </p>
            <p>
                What about gaming? Well, let’s start with the display. The 
                screen measures 6.1 inches across the diagonal and has a 21:9 
                aspect ratio — something Sony pioneered with last year’s Xperia 
                1, 10, and 5 phones. Sony has upped the game (pun intended) by 
                jumping to a <a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phone-refresh-rate-90hz-
                120hz-1086643/" 
                target="_blank">120Hz refresh</a> rate with 240Hz sampling rate. 
                That means scrolling and other on-screen action will be smooth, 
                so creators can see exactly what their content will look like 
                as a finished product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you use headphones or the built-in speakers, you can 
                expect top-notch sound from the device, says Sony. Sony goes on 
                to extol the virtues of its sound processing, which should 
                deliver balanced stereo sound from the speakers, as well as 
                upscaled goodness from just about any audio codec. We’ll reserve 
                judgement until we hear for ourselves.

                The last tentpole is performance, and it’s an easy one for Sony 
                to address. The phone ships with the<a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-snapdragon-865-
                phones-1062094/" 
                target="_blank">Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor</a>. 
                This is the standard version of the chip, not the "<a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-865-
                plus-1084310/" 
                target="_blank">plus</a>" variant that has higher clock speeds. 
                Even so, you should expect the phone to be quick. A new graphene 
                sheet inside helps dissipate heat more evenly across the phone, 
                so it won’t get as hot as last year’s Xperia 5 did. The phone 
                has 8GB of RAM, which is a bit less than we’d like to see at 
                this price point, but at least the phone is available in 128GB 
                and 256GB variants.

                On the power front, there’s a much bigger battery inside the 
                Xperia 5 II, which has improved from 3,180mAh in last year’s 
                phone to 4,000mAh in this year’s phone. Sony says it was able 
                to fit a 25% bigger battery in the same-size chassis by 
                shrinking other components. Using an optional 21W charger will 
                net you a 50% charge in just 30 minutes. The included charger 
                takes 35 minutes to reach the same 50% mark. No wireless 
                charging, however, which is a shame.

            <p>
                Competition in the sub-$1,000 space is high. You’ve got solid 
                offerings from just about every major player, including Samsung, 
                OnePlus, Google, and even Motorola.
            </p>
            <p>
                From Samsung, it’s worth looking at the <a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-
                1062433/" target="_blank"> Galaxy S20</a> Plus or the <a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-
                1108635/" target="_blank"> Note 20</a>. Each of these phones is 
                about the same price as the Sony Xperia 5 II. The biggest 
                difference will be the size. Both Samsungs are bigger than the 
                5 II.
            </p>   
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-8-pro-
                1043096/" 
                target="_blank"></a>OnePlus 8 Pro</p> is a less-expensive 
                option that’s also a bit larger than the Xperia 5 II. OnePlus’ 
                efforts in this affordable flagship space are laudable and we 
                really liked the OnePlus 8 Pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can’t discount Google. The <a

                target="_blank"> Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL</a> may have been 
                discontinued already, but they are still viable competitors if 
                you can find them. What’s more, the <a 
                href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-5-1123659/" 
                target="_blank"> Google Pixel 5</a> is primed to make its debut 
                later this month.

                sale date, however, is not until December 4 so you’ve got a bit 
                of a wait ahead of you.

                For users in Europe, you can snag the device a little earlier 
                than that. Preorders are now live on Sony’s eStore partner 
                store. Those in the UK can book a dual SIM black or blue version 
                of the phone for <a

                off on October 15. In mainland Europe, the phone will retail 
                for <a
